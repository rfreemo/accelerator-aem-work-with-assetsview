## Activity [#]-3: Explore User Productivity Features

In this activity, you’ll explore productivity tools available in **Assets View** that make everyday asset management easier — including personalization, notifications, insights, collections, and sharing.

You will continue working in your *Training Assets* folder, but for most steps you may also use **existing images from the WKND Shared demo content** (see structure in *Dynamic Media Assets > wknd-shared > en > activities*).

### Pin Assets and Folders to the Quick Access are of My Workspace

The **My Workspace > Quick Assets** panel in Assets View gives you quick access to the assets and folders you use most frequently. You can “pin” items to this view so they are always visible when you sign in.

1. From the left navigation, select **My Workspace** to open your personalized workspace.  Notice the _Quick Access_ panel, which will probably be empty.

2. Now navigate to **Assets > WKND Shared > English > Activities**

3. Hover over the *hiking* folder tile, click the **ellipsis (⋮)** icon, and select **Pin to Quick Access**.

4. A modal dialog appears with multiple options.  Select **For Myself**.

5. In the green confirmation message choose **view** or navigate to **My Workspace** as before. The *hiking* folder now appears as a pinned item in the _Quick Access -> My pinned items_ tab.  Had you have chosen to pin for a group or organization in the previous step, the folder would instead show in the _Shared Items_ tab.

6. Click on the **ellipsis (⋮)** in your pinned item and click **Open in a new tab**.

7. The *hiking* folder opens.  Click the **ellipsis (⋮)** under an image you like and choose **Pin to Quick Access**, in the same way that you added a folder in a previous step.

8. Once again choose to pin **For Myself** and then view the results in your Quick Access area (_My Workspace > Quick Access_).

> 💡 *Pinning assets "For Myself" is similar to the “lightbox” functionality of the older Admin View assets interface*

### Use Notifications to Track Asset Activity

You can receive notifications whenever assets you care about are updated, published, or have metadata changes.  
Here you’ll _watch_ a folder, then trigger a notification later when we publish an updated image.

1. Navigate back to your *Training Assets* folder.

2. Select your folder (for example, *RobF*) and in the blue actions bar choose **Watch**.  If you don't see the _Watch_ link, show hidden items by clicking the ellipsis at the and of the bar a shown in the screenshot below.

<img alt="notifications subscribe button in header bar" src="assets/watch.png" width="480"/>

A green confirmation message will be shown when the _watch_ has been sucessfully created.

   <img alt="notification type selection modal dialog" src="assets/notifications_modal.png" width="400"/>

3. Click the **Watched Assets** link in the left menu bar.  Select the watched folder and click the **Details** link in the blue actions bar.

   <img alt="subscription confirmation message displayed" src="assets/notifications_confirm.png" width="350"/>

> 🔔 *We’ll trigger this subscription later when you publish or edit assets in Activity 4 (Dynamic Media Templates).*

### View Asset Insights and Performance Data

Assets View provides built-in reporting on how assets are used — helping you understand engagement and identify your most valuable media.

1. Navigate to **wknd-shared > en > activities > cycling** and open an image such as *cycling_hero.jpg*.

2. In the right toolbar, click the **Insights** icon (graph symbol).

   <img alt="insights icon highlighted in right toolbar" src="assets/insights_icon.png" width="380"/>

3. The **Insights panel** opens, showing key metrics like:
    - Total views
    - Downloads
    - Last viewed date
    - Engagement graph over time

   <img alt="insights graph showing views and downloads" src="assets/insights_graph.png" width="420"/>

4. Hover over data points in the graph to see exact counts.  
   The metrics reflect aggregated activity from published and shared versions of the asset.

5. Close the graph view and scroll the right-rail information panel. Note that insights are also summarized in-context next to metadata fields.

   <img alt="insights summary in right information panel" src="assets/insights_incontext.png" width="420"/>

> 📊 *Insights give you actionable feedback on which assets are most effective, without leaving the Assets interface.*

### Use Collections for Grouping and Batch Actions

Collections let you group related assets — for example, all images you plan to use in an upcoming campaign — without moving the original files.

1. From your *wknd-shared > en > activities* folder, select three images you find appealing (e.g., one each from *camping*, *climbing*, and *cycling*).

2. In the blue actions bar, click **Add to Collection**, then choose **Create New Collection**.

   <img alt="add to collection button in blue actions bar" src="assets/add_to_collection.png" width="400"/>

3. Name your collection *My Adventure Highlights* and click **Create**.

   <img alt="create collection dialog with name field" src="assets/create_collection_dialog.png" width="400"/>

4. Open your new collection from the left navigation under **Collections**.

   <img alt="collections view showing My Adventure Highlights" src="assets/collections_panel.png" width="400"/>

5. Select all assets in your collection and click **Edit Metadata** from the actions bar.  
   Change the **Title** to include your initials (e.g., “Adventure Highlights – RF”).

   <img alt="bulk metadata editor applied to collection items" src="assets/bulk_metadata_editor.png" width="420"/>

6. Click **Save**. All selected assets are updated together.

> 🗂 *Collections act as dynamic playlists for assets — you can bulk edit, publish, or share them without duplicating files.*

### Share Links and Manage Access

You can share a collection or individual asset as a secure link — useful for review or external collaboration.

1. With *My Adventure Highlights* still open, click **Share Link** in the blue header bar.

   <img alt="share link option highlighted in blue header bar" src="assets/share_link_option.png" width="420"/>

2. In the dialog, set:
    - ✅ *Allow download*
    - ⚙️ *Link expires in*: 7 days
    - Optionally, add a message for recipients.

   <img alt="share link settings dialog with expiration and download options" src="assets/share_link_settings.png" width="420"/>

3. Click **Create Link**. A shareable URL appears.

   <img alt="share link confirmation with URL shown" src="assets/share_link_created.png" width="420"/>

4. Copy the link and paste it in a browser tab to preview what an external viewer sees.

   <img alt="external preview of shared assets gallery" src="assets/share_link_preview.png" width="420"/>

5. Return to your collection and note the small **link icon** indicating that a share link exists.

> 🔗 *Share links allow easy external collaboration without requiring AEM user credentials. Access can be revoked anytime from the Share dialog.*
