## Activity 1-1: Access DA

In this activity we will access the Document Authoring environment.

1. Navigate to [Document Authoring - da.live](https://da.live). You should now see the page below.

    <img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-gettingstarted/assets/3.png" width="480" />

2. In a clean browser window (e.g. incognito tab), login using the **Sign In** link on the top right of the page, using the credentials provided by your instructor.
3. Click on the account logo in the top right of the page, and check that the Organization is correct, according to the instructions provided by your instructor.

    <img src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-gettingstarted/assets/correct-org-da.png" width="240" />

## Activity 1-2: Create a page

Let's add some content!

1. Enter the site URL provided by your instructor in to the **browser address bar**, in the format (similar to _da.live/some organization/da-getting-started_)
2. Open the **enablement** directory.
3. In the breadcrumb, click **new**

    <img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-gettingstarted/assets/new.png" width="380"/>

4. Choose _folder_ from the dropdown menu.
5. Enter an initial and your name, e.g. jbrown, in the textfield and click **create folder**

    <img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-gettingstarted/assets/create_folder.png" width="580"/>

6. Your folder should appear in the main page area. Click once on the folder.
7. As previously click on **new**, then choose **Document** from the dropdown menu.
8. Enter _Getting Started_ in the textfield and note that the text is modified to a URL friendly version; _getting-started_.
9. Click **Create document**.  The new document(page) is opened in the document editor.

    <img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-gettingstarted/assets/getting-started-page.png" width="580"/>

## Activity 1-3 Editing Documents

The **edit menu** (left side of the page) offers a number of options to support adding content:

**Edit Text**: Format copy (heading size, bold, italics, etc)

**Edit Link**: Add/edit linked text (first highlight the text to enable this option)

**List**: Add numbered or bulleted text

**Library**: This opens a secondary menu where you can add blocks, placeholders, tags, and other content to the page.

**Block**: Add a basic columns block to the page.

**Section**: Add a section break to the page to separate sections of content

1. Click the block icon in the menu to add the default columns block to the page.

    <img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-gettingstarted/assets/add_block.png" width="580"/>

2. To delete the block you can click the undo icon (towards the bottom of the edit menu) or delete using the mouse and keyboard. We'll use the mouse and keyboard: move the mouse pointer in to the header of the block, then click and hold the mouse button while dragging down into the bottom right area of the block so that the whole block is highlighted.  Then release the mouse button. The block should now be highlighted in blue as shown below.

    <img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-gettingstarted/assets/selected-block.png" width="580"/>

3. Press the delete key on your keyboard to delete the columns block.
4. Click the library icon in the edit bar (see the screenshot below) to see a menu of items that you can add to the page.

    <img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-gettingstarted/assets/library.png" width="300"/>

5. Type _hero_ in the search area.  Click on the _hero_ block that appears in the search results to add a Hero block to the page.
6. Close the library menu and click in the hero text _Heading in Block_.  Change the text to _I got started!_

    <img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-gettingstarted/assets/i_got_started.png" width="580"/>

## Activity 1-4: Adding and removing tables / blocks

> Working with tables to add Blocks in DA is similar to Word, although there are some differences to not and techniques to remember!

2. Open your document and use the Edit Bar **Block** button to add a table below your previous work.  Note that a block (columns) is added as the default table.

    <img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-gettingstarted/modules/m4-work-with-tables/assets/add_block2.png" width="280"/>

3. Click **again** on the **Block** button and note that the behaviour has changed.  Your cursor is still in the first table, and the Edit Menu is contextual, so you now see table edit functions.

    <img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-gettingstarted/assets/edit_table.png" width="480"/>

4. Add a column or edit the table if you wish, then click (place your cursor) immediately below the table.

5. Once again click on **Block** in the Edit Menu.

6. You now have the issue that there is no room between tables. To solve this **click in the margin** of the lower table as shown below.  This will give you a horizontal cursor between the tables and you can add an empty line or edit.

    <img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-gettingstarted/assets/close_tables.png" width="300"/>

7. In the first DA exercise you deleted a table by selecting and using the delete key. **Delete one of your tables** using this technique.

8. An alternative approach is so use the table edit menu.  Place your cursor in the remaining table, click on **Block** in the Edit Bar, then the last edit icon, _Delete Table_.

    <img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-gettingstarted/assets/delete_table.png" width="480"/>

## Activity 1-5: Forward Slash Inline Menu

> DA has a nice authoring optimization feature - the forward slash menu.

1. Still in your _Tables_ document, plage your cursor in the empty main page area.

2. Type a **forward-slash** character, followed by _bl_.  Note that the available objects (mostly blocks) are immediately available for your use.  Select one of the items to add it to the page.

    <img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-gettingstarted/assets/slash_menu.png" width="200"/>

## Activity 2-1 Page preview and versions

1. Preview the page you created preview in the previous module by clicking the blue paper plane button in the **Action Area**, then select “Preview”. The preview page will automatically open in a new browser tab.

    <img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m2-versions-and-search/assets/preview.png" width="580"/>

2. You can also view a live preview as you make updates to the page. Click the devices icon in the **Preview Menu** near the top right corner of the page, then select a device to resize the viewport (mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop).
3. Click the versions icon on the right of the document as shown below.

    <img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m2-versions-and-search/assets/version_button.png" width="240"/>

    > You now see a timeline of changes made to the page (similar to below). DA automatically records an entry whenever a page is updated; however, these entries cannot be used to revert a page to a previous state, unless either a preview/publish action is made using the paper aeroplane icon or you manually create a version.

4. Click on _+ Now_ to manually create a version, and enter a suitable label, for example a JIRA ticket number or description.  For the exercise you can use "_Start of Activity 2_1_".  Press enter.

    <img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m2-versions-and-search/assets/versions.png" width="240"/>

5. Click the home button of the DA interface to leave the document.  Then navigation back to it (in /enablement/yourname).  Open the versions pane again as you did in previous steps.

    > Each time a DA document is opened, an entry is added to the versions pane. However, only versions that are manually created or on preview/publish can be restored.
    >
    > A gray dot indicates a change, while a green dot (or when expanded, a green back arrow) represents a saved version.

    <img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m2-versions-and-search/assets/versions_list2.png" width="240"/>

6. Make a change to your document, for example by changing the hero text from _I got started_ to _I made a mistake_.
7. Open the versions pane if not already open and click on the version you created earlier (_start of Activity 2-1_).
8. A layer opens containing the versioned content.  Click the **restore** button at the top of the layer.

    <img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m2-versions-and-search/assets/restore.png" width="340"/>

9.  Check the hero text.  It has been changed back to the earlier version.
10. Now click the **<** symbol to the left of your current folder in the **Title Area** (top left) to close the document and return to the folder view.

    <img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m2-versions-and-search/assets/return_folder.png" width="280"/>

11. Click the **ellipsis** to the right of your getting-started document, as shown below.  This is a useful way to see the status of your documents.

    <img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m2-versions-and-search/assets/status_preview.png" width="540"/>

## Activity 2-2 Search

We will now use the search functionality. This will search normal document content, as you would expect, but also the metadata and folder names.

1. Using the breadcrumb, navigate to the top level of your site (_da-getting-started_).
2. Click on the Search tab in the **Title Area** of the page.
3. Enter _productivity_ in the search field and click **search**

    <img src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m2-versions-and-search/assets/search_productivity.png" alt="screenshot of exercise" width="540">

4. The results are from the standard EDS demo content.
5. Click on one of the results and search for the word _productivity_ using the browser search function (Windows: CTRL + F, Mac CMD + F).  The browser finds and highlights the search term.
6. Click in the **Title Area** on the **<** symbol to return to the containing folder, then back to your site home in the breadcrumb (da-getting-started).
7. Change the work _productivity_ to _effectiveness_ by repeating the search and then checking the Replace checkbox, entering the term _effectiveness_ and then clicking replace.

    <img src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m2-versions-and-search/assets/replace.png" alt="screenshot of exercise" width="540">

    The grey search shows a message similar to _Replaced 2 of 2 in 1.57 seconds._
8. Open one of the documents and confirm that EDS now promotes developer _effectiveness_ and not _productivity_.


# Module 3: Media

#### Introduction

In this module, you will learn how to use media in the DA environment.

### Activity 3-1: Simple Images

The easiest way to add images to a DA page is to simply drag and drop from your own file system.

1. If not already open, **open** your **getting-started** document in DA.
2. **Delete** the image from your Hero component.
3. Open the Exercise_Files folder (from the zip provided by your instructor) beside your browser and **drag** the image _snowboard_jump.jpeg_ above in to the empty space where your previous image was (above the headline in e Hero block).
4. Click the paper aeroplane symbol, then **preview**.  The preview opens in a new browser tab.

    <img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-media/assets/preview_snowboarder.png" width="480"/>

    > The original snowboarder image is a 5862px wide JPEG, so not suitable for direct use in a webpage.  In DA we see this full-size JPEG image, but in the previewed or published EDS page we see a web optimized (webp) version with a maximum width of 2000px.  The image is adaptive, with optimal sizes used, depending on the browser width.  This important optimization has been made by the EDS image processing system.
    >
    > Despite this functionality uploading unnecessarily large images should be avoided asit can make DA document load, i.e. authoring, slower.  You may notice this when working with this file in your document.

### Activity 3-2: AEM Assets Images

In this activity we will use AEM Assets as an image source.

1. Return to your getting-started document in DA.
2. Delete the image in the Hero component and place your cursor in the empty space.
3. Open the **Library** dialog and click on **AEM Assets**.  An AEM Assets overlay appears.  This may take a few seconds to load.

    <img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-media/assets/open_aem_assets.png" width="540"/>

4. Navigate to the _wknd shared > en > activities > skiing_ folder and select one of the images by checking the appropriate checkbox and clicking **Select**.

    <img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-media/assets/select_asset.png" width="540"/>

5. Use the paper aeroplane icon to preview your page.  The image should render correctly, although it has been dynamically cropped to fit the Hero banner requirements.

### Activity 3-3: Embedding non-image Assets

Non-image assets need to be treated a bit differently, and cannot simply be dragged/pasted into the page. Instead they are uploaded to a folder and then referenced on the page. We will upload and use a video in this exercise.

1. Navigate to the _enablement/yourname/_ folder (in reality we would use a suitable media folder following your organization's guidelines).
2. Click the blue **new** button, but select **Media**, then **Select File**, and then select _snow.mp4_ from the _Exercise_Files_.
3. Click “Upload".

    <img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-media/assets/upload_video.png" width="420"/>

4. Once your new file appears inside the folder, **click** to open it.
5. An editor style page will open up. Click the blue paper plane button and then “Preview”. This is an important step, otherwise the asset will not render when added to a page.

    <img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-media/assets/publish_video.png" width="420"/>

6. Copy the preview URL from the browser address bar.
7. Open your _getting_started document, open the **library dialog**, select **blocks** and add an **embed** block to your page. If you see more than one _embed_ option, you pick the first in the list.  An **embed** block is inserted with some sample content.
8. Delete the sample content, then drag in the **snow_still.png image** in to the block body.  This image is a placeholger for the video itself.
9. Paste in the **video preview link** you copied earlier, below the image.  Your _embed_ block should look like this:

    <img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-media/assets/embed_in_preparation.png" width="480"/>

10. Highlight the URL and use the hyperlink tool to convert the text to a link as shown below.

    <img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-media/assets/hyperlink.png" width="420"/>

11. Click on the paper aeroplane icon and **preview** the document. Note that only the snow video is shown on the page (not the link or placeholder image).
