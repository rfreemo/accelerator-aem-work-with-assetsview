Edit and Versions</h3>
<h4 id="create-a-folder-and-upload-an-image">Create a folder and upload
an image</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open <em>Experience Manager Assets</em> from the chocolate bar
menu.</p></li>
<li><p>Navigate to <em>Asset Management &gt; Assets &gt; WKND Shared
&gt; English &gt; Training Assets</em> and use the <strong>Create
Folder</strong> button to create a folder using your first name and an
initial, if necessary, e.g., <em>RobF</em>.
<img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-introduction/assets/image2.jpeg" width="480"/></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Drag and drop</strong> the exercise image from the
<em>Exercise_Files</em> folder on to your newly created folder. The
<em>Upload Files</em> modal dialog appears.</p></li>
<li><p>Leave the checkbox <em>Publish to AEM and Dynamic Media</em>
<strong>unchecked</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-introduction/assets/upload.png" width="357"/></p></li>
<li><p>A green bar and success message is shown if the upload was
successful, and a placeholder image should be shown shortly afterwards
with a <strong><em>Processing</em></strong> label. The asset is being
processed by AEM as a Cloud Service <em>Asset Microservices</em>.
<strong>Be patient</strong> - this process can take more than a minute
to complete.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the UI has updated, and the image has a <em>New</em> label,
click the <strong>ellipsis</strong> (three dots) below the thumbnail of
the image you just uploaded.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-introduction/assets/image6.png" width="357"/></p></li>
<li><p>Choose <strong>Edit</strong>. A limited version of <strong>Adobe
Express</strong> will open. <strong>Make any change</strong>, such as
cropping your image.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Save</strong> As, then
<strong>Version</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-introduction/assets/image7.png" width="480"/></p></li>
<li><p>Image processing starts, as happened when you first uploaded the
image. Click the <strong>back arrow</strong> to the folder.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-introduction/assets/image8.png" width="244"/></p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="use-the-version-viewer">Use the Version Viewer</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Once processing has completed, <strong>double-click on the
asset</strong> to open it and click the ‘Versions’ (clock) icon in the
right toolbar.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-introduction/assets/image9.png" width="321"/></p></li>
<li><p>Select a previous version (the original). The image area now
shows the side-by-side comparison tool. Use this to inspect the changes
made in Adobe Express.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Make Latest</strong> to restore the original
version.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="switch-view">Switch View</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>While you are waiting for the reverted image to be processed, try
out the <strong>Switch View</strong> link to change to the same folder
in the <strong>Admin View</strong> (the older Touch UI Experience
Manager author instance).</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-introduction/assets/switchview.png" width="321"/></p></li>
<li><p>Note that the URL of the page has changed to a standard
Experience Manager author URL, such as
<code>https://author-p123456-e123456.adobeaemcloud.com</code>. This is
because you are now using the Experience Manager Assets instance
directly, not via the new Assets View interface.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Switch View</strong> allows you to move between the Admin and
Assets View, in both directions, while using Assets. It is particularly
useful if you have an error or missing feature in the Assets View and
want to try the same operation in the older interface.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Use the <strong>Switch View</strong> link to change back to
<strong>Assets View</strong>. Check that the URL now starts with
<code>https://experience.adobe.com/?repoId=</code> to confirm that you
are in Assets View.</li>

<h4 id="publish">Publish</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open the test image by double clicking on it.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the <strong>Switch View</strong> link to change to the same
image in the <strong>Admin View</strong> (‘traditional’ Experience
Manager).</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-introduction/assets/switchview.png" width="380"/></p></li>
<li><p>Once the image is open in the Admin View, copy the URL from the
address bar. This should be similar to below but without the spaces
between URL segments.</p>
<pre><code>https://author-p123456-e123456.adobeaemcloud.com  /ui#/aem/assets.html  /content/dam/wknd-shared/en/Training%20Assets/yourfolder/landscape_image_metadata_test.jpg  ?appId=aemshell</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Construct the URL for the image on the Experience Manager publish
server by replacing the word <strong>author</strong> with
<strong>publish</strong>, and removing the elements
<em>/ui#/aem/assets.html</em> (this is the editing interface) and
<em>?appId=aemshell</em>, giving you a URL like this:</p>
<pre><code>https://publish-p123456-e123456.adobeaemcloud.com/content/dam/wknd-shared/en/Training%20Assets/yourfolder/landscape_image_metadata_test.jpg</code></pre></li>
<li><p>In a new tab or window navigate to the new URL in your browser
address bar (new tab or window) and you should get a <strong>Not
Found</strong> error. This is because the image has not been published
(if you do see the image at this point, you may have published it by
mistake when uploading).</p></li>
<li><p>In the Experience Manager editor use the <strong>switch
view</strong> to move from Admin View back to Assets View.</p></li>
<li><p>Navigate to the containing folder (<em>Training Assets</em>,
select the image and click <strong>publish</strong> in the blue actions
bar.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-introduction/assets/publish.png" width="480"/></p></li>
<li><p>Select the <em>AEM</em> checkbox in the modal dialog and
<strong>publish</strong>. A green notification panel will confirm that
the image was published.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-introduction/assets/publish_modal.png" width="380"/></p></li>
<li><p>Once again enter the publish instance URL for the image in a new
tab (the URL is <strong>similar</strong> to below). This time there will
be no <em>Not Found</em> error and the published image will either open,
or download.</p>
<pre><code>https://publish-p123456-e123456.adobeaemcloud.com/content/dam/wknd-shared/en/Training%20Assets/yourfolder/landscape_image_metadata_test.jpg</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Open the details panel of the test image and scroll to the bottom
of the panel. Note that the publish state and publishing time of the
asset is shown.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-introduction/assets/publishdata.png" width="380"/></p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The publish mechanism creates a copy of the asset on the Experience
Manager publish server, and optionally to the Dynamic Media delivery
server.<br />
Until the release of the latest generation of AEM Assets tools (ca.
2024), this was the standard way to make images available for use by
asset consumers, or for use in Experience Manager (Sites) web pages.</p>
<p>We do not <strong>approve</strong> images in this exercise as we are
not using one of the new delivery channels (Content Hub or the Dynamic
Media API). Approval is a metadata field that only becomes relevant when
using these systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="review-published-renditions">Review Published Renditions</h4>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li><p>Once again look at the Dynamic Renditions of the image. You will
not see that you can copy the live URL of each rendition - click on
<strong>Copy URL</strong> to do this and paste into a browser to view
the image.</p>

<h3 id="activity-1-3-delete-and-restore-the-image">Activity 1-3: Delete
and Restore the image</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Navigate to your folder and use the ellipsis menu to delete your
test image, clicking first on the <strong>delete</strong> button in the
menu, then again on the delete button in the modal confirmation layer.
The image is removed from the UI.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-introduction/assets/delete_image.png" width="240"/></p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>In Admin View (Touch UI) delete is a final operation. Without the
restoration of a backup this cannot be undone. Assets View is different
and has a Trash folder. Images deleted using Assets View can be
restored.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>As only asset and folder titles are visible in the Trash tile
view, it can be difficult to find an image if there are others, as is
likely the case if your fellow students have also deleted their test
images. To overcome this, change to the <strong>list view</strong> as
shown below:</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-introduction/assets/trash_tileview.png" width="480"/></p></li>
<li><p>Locate your deleted image, click the ellipsis and then

<h3 id="activity-2-1-access-metadata">Activity 2-1: Access Metadata</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In the Assets View UI click the information icon in the details
panel of your image, inspect the <strong>metadata</strong> in the
<em>Basic</em> and <em>Advanced</em> tabs. The metadata fields you see
are the defaults provided by Adobe, and reveal commonly used information
such as the image description.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m2-metadata_search/assets/info.png" width="320"/></p></li>
<li><p>The image has much more metadata that you do not currently see.
You can see <strong>some</strong> of this ‘hidden’ metadata by
inspecting the source image in the activity-files. Do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In MacOS right-click on the image and click on <strong>Get
info</strong> (result as in the screenshot below)</p></li>
<li><p>In Windows 11, right-click, then choose
<strong>Properties</strong>, then <strong>Details</strong>. You will see
the following:</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m2-metadata_search/assets/metadata.png" width="400"/></p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason you only see part of the metadata is because Adobe, and
the system administrator, have applied <strong>Metadata Forms</strong>,
so defining which metadata fields are visible and editable in the Assets
View user interface (these Metadata Forms are the equivalent of Metadata
Schemas in Admin View). By changing the Metadata Forms applied to
folders and MIME types, different metadata can be shown and edited, as
required for the asset management in your company.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="activity-2-2-apply-metadata-forms">Activity 2-2: Apply Metadata
Forms</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>From the left menu, select <strong>Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Metadata Forms</strong>. You may see an empty page if only the
default configurations are used as these defaults are invisible in the
UI. You can see the defaults by either:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>View the metadata in the details of an asset as we did in the
previous exercise.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a new form using an existing form structure as the
template. Although this is <strong>normally a power user or
administrator responsibility</strong>, we’ll do that now:</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In the Metadata Forms panel, click <strong>Create</strong>, then
enter *&lt;your initials&gt;_default* in the Name field of
<strong>Create Metadata Form</strong> panel, eg.,
<em>js_default</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m2-metadata_search/assets/new_form.png" width="245"/></p>
<p>(if you were to name the new form <em>default</em> you would override
the standard default form - <strong>DON’T do that</strong> in this
exercise. The default is applied to any assets that do not have forms
specific to their MIME types).</p></li>
<li><p>Select the <strong>checkbox</strong> <em>use existing form
structure as template</em> and the select <em>default</em> in the
<strong>Choose from</strong> field. Click
<strong>Create</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The Metadata Form Editor is loaded. The fields shown are copied
from the standard <em>default</em> form.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m2-metadata_search/assets/image17.png" width="602"/></p></li>
<li><p>We will make the metadata property <em>photoshop:City</em>
visible and editable in Assets View (photoshop:City is an Adobe metadata
field that could conceivably be important for your company, as the
location where the image was created or edited, however we are using it
merely as an example without a defined use-case!). Add a single-line
text field to the bottom of the form, then configure the form using:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Metadata property: City (photoshop:City)</p></li>
<li><p>Label: Photoshop City</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m2-metadata_search/assets/metadatacity.png" width="602"/></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Save</strong>, wait for a success message, then
<strong>Close</strong> to exit the form editor.</p></li>
<li><p>As your form is named neither <em>default</em> nor a MIME type,
it will not be used anywhere yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A MIME type simply tells the system what kind of file an asset is,
which determines what metadata can be stored and used—for example, PNG
and JPG images have image-related metadata (like dimensions or color
profile), while a PDF has document-related metadata (like pages, text,
and author).</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Now assign your form to your folder in Training Assets by
clicking <strong>Assign to Folders</strong> in the blue header bar, then
selecting <strong>your folder</strong> and clicking
<strong>Assign</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m2-metadata_search/assets/assign.png" width="602"/></p></li>
<li><p>Open your training asset detail. Your modified metadata form has
been applied and the field Photoshop City should now be visible, contain
<em>Offenburg</em> and be editable.</p></li>
<li><p>Return to your folder and upload in to your folder the
<strong>test.pdf</strong> file in your Exercise_Files.</p></li>
<li><p>After the asset has been processed open the details view and note
that your <strong>custom metadata form</strong> is being used, This may
not be desirable as a PDF is a different MIME type to an image, and by
default has a different, PDF specific, metadata form. An example issue
is that photoshop:City is irrelevant for a PDF.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="activity-2-3-metadata-challenge">Activity 2-3: Metadata
challenge!</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Solve this problem of the PDF file having the metadata
configuration of an image. Your PDF and your Image should be able to
exist inside your folder or child-folder(s), but with different,
MIME-type appropriate, metadata fields. The PDF should have the default
PDF metadata visible, and the image should have your custom metadata
visible.</p>

<li><p>You will see fewer images and a <em>Create Date</em> search
filter has been automatically added to the header search bar. This is
the result of the natural language search - creation of search
filters.</p></li>
<li><p>Experiment with natural language searches to explore the limits
of the contextual search.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is possible to add a custom filter to the search, for example the
photoshop:City. We will not do this as it is a central configuration
that we cannot change without conflict on the training system. In
reality it will be managed by an administrator, or power user. You
should just remember that configuration of search filters is possible,
and straightforward in most cases.</p>

<h3 id="activity-3-1-my-workspace-and-quick-access">Activity 3-1: My
Workspace and Quick Access</h3>
<p>The <strong>My Workspace &gt; Quick Assets</strong> panel in Assets
View gives you quick access to the assets and folders you use most
frequently. You can “pin” items to this view so they are always visible
when you sign in.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>From the left navigation, select <strong>My Workspace</strong> to
open your personalized workspace. Notice the <em>Quick Access</em>
panel, which will probably be empty.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-productivity/assets/myworkspace.png" width="200"/></p></li>
<li><p>Now navigate to <strong>Assets &gt; WKND Shared &gt; English &gt;
Activities</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may still be in the <strong>List view</strong> from a previous
exercise. To make your system look like the screenshots, you can return
to <strong>Grid View</strong>, use the view switcher (top right of the
main panel)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Hover over the <em>hiking</em> folder tile, click the
<strong>ellipsis</strong>, and select <strong>Pin to Quick
Access</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-productivity/assets/pin_folder_menu.png" width="480"/></p></li>
<li><p>A modal dialog appears with multiple options. Select <strong>For
Myself</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>In the green confirmation message choose <strong>view</strong> or
navigate to <strong>My Workspace</strong> as before. The <em>hiking</em>
folder now appears as a pinned item in the <em>Quick Access -&gt; My
pinned items</em> tab. Had you chosen to pin for a group or organization
in the previous step, the folder would instead show in the <em>Shared
Items</em> tab.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-productivity/assets/my_pinned_items.png" width="320"/></p></li>
<li><p>Click on the <strong>ellipsis</strong> in your pinned item and
click <strong>Open in a new tab</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-productivity/assets/open_pinned_item.png" width="420"/></p></li>
<li><p>The <em>hiking</em> folder opens. Click the
<strong>ellipsis</strong> under an image you like and choose <strong>Pin
to Quick Access</strong>, in the same way that you added a folder in a
previous step.</p></li>
<li><p>Once again choose to pin <strong>For Myself</strong> and then
view the results in your Quick Access area (<em>My Workspace &gt; Quick
Access</em>).</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Pinning assets <em>For Myself</em> is similar to the
<em>lightbox</em> functionality of the older Admin View assets
interface</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="activity-3-2-use-notifications-to-track-asset-activity">Activity
3-2: Use Notifications to Track Asset Activity</h3>
<p>You can receive notifications whenever assets you care about are
updated, published, or have metadata changes. Here you’ll <em>watch</em>
a folder, then trigger a notification later when we publish an updated
image.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Navigate to the <em>Training Assets</em> folder.</p></li>
<li><p>(Tip: Read the next step before completing this one!) Select your
folder (for example, <em>RobF</em>) and in the blue actions bar choose
<strong>Watch</strong>. If you don’t see the <em>Watch</em> link, show
hidden items by clicking the ellipsis at the end of the bar a shown in
the screenshot below.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-productivity/assets/watch.png" width="480"/></p></li>
<li><p>A green confirmation message will be shown when the
<em>watch</em> has been successfully created. Note that a link to your
<strong>Notification Preferences</strong> is shown in the success
message. Click on this. If the message is no longer visible, you can
<strong>unwatch</strong> and <strong>watch</strong> again.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-productivity/assets/watch_notification.png" width="480"/></p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Notifications -&gt; Assets</strong> area of the
preferences page, ensure that all items are set to
<strong>In-app</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-productivity/assets/xc_notifications.png" width="380"/></p></li>
<li><p>Close the tab containing the notifications settings, so returning
to the Assets View UI.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Watched Assets</strong> link in the left menu
bar. Select the watched folder to see a list of your watches.</p>
<p><img alt="watched assets" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-productivity/assets/watched_assets.png" width="220"/></p></li>
</ol>

<p>We’ll trigger this subscription later when you publish or edit assets
in a later module.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="activity-3-3-insights-and-reporting">Activity 3-3: Insights and
Reporting</h3>
<h4 id="view-asset-insights">View Asset Insights</h4>
<p>Assets View provides automatically generated insights that show how
assets are being used over time. These insights are available at a
global level and help authors understand overall asset usage trends.</p>
<p>In this activity, you’ll open the Insights view and review the
available charts.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>From the left navigation pane, click the Insights <em>graph
icon</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="watched assets" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-productivity/assets/insights.png" width="220"/></p>
<p>The Insights page opens, displaying automatically generated charts
based on asset usage.</p></li>
<li><p>Review the available charts.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the time range dropdowns to explore how asset activity
changes over time.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Insights provide authors with a simple high-level, read-only view of
asset usage without running reports or modifying content.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="activity-3-4-collections">Activity 3-4: Collections</h3>
<h4 id="create-and-add-assets-to-a-collection">Create and add assets to
a collection</h4>
<p>Collections let you group related assets — for example, all images
you plan to use in an upcoming campaign — without moving the original
files.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We’ll start by creating an empty Collection. Click on the
Collections icon in the sidebar, then <strong>Create a
Collection</strong>. Give you collection a simple name such as
_your-initials-_Collection, select the <strong>private</strong> open and
click <strong>Create</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-productivity/assets/create_collection.png" width="420"/></p></li>
<li><p>From the <em>WKND Shared &gt; English &gt; Activities</em>
folder, find three images that you like, and for each:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click <strong>Add to Collection</strong> in the blue action menu
bar, then choose your Collection and click <strong>Add</strong>. A
confirmation message is shown and the Collection modal closes.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-productivity/assets/add-to-collection2.png" width="420"/></p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>You can also use an Asset’s ellipsis menu to <em>Add to
Collection</em>.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Navigate again to <strong>Collections</strong>.You see your
chosen images.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the images are <strong>not</strong> copies of the
originals. The collection is a kind of virtual folder containing only
references to the original images. For example you can delete a
Collection without the contained images being deleted from the system. A
collection is not as fully featured as a genuine folder. For example a
Collection cannot be used for bulk operations such as applying metadata,
nor can a Metadata Form be applied to a Collection.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="investigate-collection-permissions">Investigate collection
permissions</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>As you create a <strong>private</strong> collection, you can
control the access rights to your collection. To do this view your
Collection in the Collections panel, and choose <strong>Manage
permissions</strong> from the ellipsis menu.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-productivity/assets/collections_permissions.png" width="240"/></p></li>
<li><p>Note that you have automatically been added as the Collection
owner.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-productivity/assets/collections_permissions.png" width="240"/></p></li>
<li><p>We won’t apply and test permissions in this course, but if you’re
working with another student, feel free to experiment with the
permissions system by assigning permissions to them. To do this the next
section, sharing, may come in useful!</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="activity-3-5-sharing-links">Activity 3-5: Sharing links</h3>
<p>You can share a collection, folder or individual asset as a secure
link — useful for review or external collaboration.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Choose your original test image and choose <strong>Share
link</strong> from the ellipsis menu.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-productivity/assets/share_link.png" width="240"/></p></li>
<li><p>Copy the link from the link share dialog, and note that the link
has a unique ID. It is not just a simple path to the entity that you
shared, and does have an expiry time which you can set at this
point.</p></li>
<li><p>Open an incognito window, or a different browser in which you are
<strong>NOT logged in</strong> with an Adobe account.</p></li>
<li><p>Paste the shared link into the address bar. Notice the link is to
an author URL such as:
<code>https://author-p123456-e123456.adobeaemcloud.com/linkshare.html?sh=_long_unique_id</code>,
and all content on an author instance would normally require
authentication.</p></li>
<li><p>Click return and see that image is visible and can be downloaded
by your simulated <strong>unauthenticated user</strong> in the Link
Share viewer</p>

<h1 id="module-4-dynamic-media-templates">Module 4: Dynamic Media
Templates</h1>
<h4 id="introduction-3">Introduction</h4>
<p>In this activity you will learn to use the Dynamic Media Template
Editor.</p>
<p>The scenario for this is:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="https://wknd.enablementadobe.com/us/en.html">WKND
website</a> team have identified that their logo and website header
combination does not fit the brand well, and should be updated to
present a more adventurous, exciting or exotic feel to the website.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m4-dm_templates/assets/wknd2.png" width="480"/></p>
<ul>
<li>The logo area should change weekly giving the website a fresh look
for returning visitors.</li>
<li>To make changes in logo position, font, colour and background images
would need either ongoing work by the creative team, and/or development
work to make changes to the page HTML and styling.</li>
<li>The team have decided to try Dynamic Media Templates so that the
website authors can make changes to the logo area dynamically using URL
parameters that they will define in Dynamic Media templates, and
configure in the Experience Manager header component.</li>
<li>In the activity we will prepare a proof-of-concept logo and
background image for the team.<br />
</li>
<li>The logo will only be used on full screen views. The logo size is
320 x 200px.</li>

<h3 id="activity-4-1-create-a-dynamic-media-template">Activity 4-1:
Create a Dynamic Media Template</h3>
<h4 id="create-a-dynamic-media-template">Create a Dynamic Media
Template</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>From the left navigation, select <strong>Dynamic Media
Assets</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Navigate to your training folder created earlier in the course,
then open the <strong>dynamic_media</strong> subfolder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note! you do not see your images as only Dynamic Media assets are
visible in this view.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Create Template</strong> (top right). A modal
dialog opens.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m4-dm_templates/assets/create_template.png" width="480"/></p></li>
<li><p>Enter a template name using your initials, for example
<em>rf_template</em>, and leave the canvas size at the default 500x500.
The template editor opens.</p></li>
<li><p>Take a moment to <strong>explore the user interface</strong>,
particularly the buttons in the right menu, for <strong>accessing
assets, adding text, managing layers and adding shapes</strong>. You can
undo anything you create with the <em>undo</em> icon in the left menu or
Ctrl+Z (Windows), Cmd+Z (Mac).</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the search will only show assets that have been processed
for use with Dynamic Media. You may not see all assets on the
system.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="recreate-the-existing-basic-logo">Recreate the existing basic
logo</h4>
<p>First recreate the existing logo: a simple black WKND SVG roughly in
the middle of the canvas.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Use the <strong>shapes</strong> menu to add a white rectangle,
then adjust it to cover the entire canvas.</p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>asset picker</strong>, search for
<em>wknd-logo</em> and drag <strong>wknd-logo-dk.svg</strong> on to the
canvas.</p></li>
<li><p>Authors will want to <strong>move, resize and change the source
image</strong>. Additionally the image should <strong>link to the WKND
home page</strong>
(<code>https://wknd.enablementadobe.com/us/en.html</code>). You can meet
these requirements by exposing the appropriate properties as
<strong>parameters</strong> as shown below (layer properties /
parameters tabs)</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m4-dm_templates/assets/logo_cta.png" width="200"/></p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m4-dm_templates/assets/logo_parameters.png" width="200"/></p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="select-the-background-image">Select the background image</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Upload one of the images from the activity-files/dm_templates
folder in to your folder in <em>Training Assets</em> (or choose a
background image of your own).</p></li>
<li><p>Back in the Template editor, use the asset browser from the icon
in the right column to find and drag your uploaded image on to the
canvas.</p></li>
<li><p>Resize the image to cover the canvas.</p></li>
<li><p>In the left menu of the editor, reorder your layers so that the
WKND logo is at the front.</p></li>
<li><p>Make the source of the image a parameter so that the authors can
dynamically change the image.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>At this stage you should have a usable banner, similar to the one
shown in the screenshot below (depending on which image you chose):</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m4-dm_templates/assets/example_banner.png" width="420"/></p>
<h4 id="preview-the-image-and-test-parameters">Preview the image and
test parameters</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Save the template then preview (both buttons on the top
right).</p></li>
<li><p>In the preview mode you can see and adjust the properties that
are exposed as parameters. Try swapping the logo for the light version
and moving it.</p></li>
<li><p>Change some parameters, then click <strong>publish</strong>, and
<strong>copy URL</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m4-dm_templates/assets/copy_url3.jpg" width="420"/></p></li>
<li><p>Examine the URL. Notice that the parameters you chose are
included in the URL. Removing or changing them will allow you (and the
authors) to dynamically change the image.</p></li>
<li><p>Paste the URL into a browser tab and request the image.</p></li>
</ol>
