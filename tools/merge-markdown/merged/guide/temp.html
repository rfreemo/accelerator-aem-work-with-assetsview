to complete.</p>
<p>The UI will then automatically update and the label will change to
<strong><em>new</em></strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>ellipsis</strong> (three dots) below the

<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-introduction/assets/switchview.png" width="321"/></p></li>
<li><p>Once the image is open in the Admin View, copy the URL from the
address bar. This should be similar to below but thout the spaces
between URL segments.</p>
<pre><code>https://author-p123456-e123456.adobeaemcloud.com  /ui#/aem/assets.html  /content/dam/wknd-shared/en/Training%20Assets/yourfolder/landscape_image_metadata_test.jpg  ?appId=aemshell</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Construct the URL for the image on the Experience Manager publish
server by replacing the word <strong>author</strong> with
<strong>publish</strong>, and removing the the elements
<em>/ui#/aem/assets.html</em> (this is the editing interface) and
<em>?appId=aemshell</em>, giving you a URL like this:</p>
<pre><code>https://publish-p123456-e123456.adobeaemcloud.com/content/dam/wknd-shared/en/Training%20Assets/yourfolder/landscape_image_metadata_test.jpg</code></pre></li>
<li><p>In a new tab or window navigate to the new URL in your browser
address bar (new tab or window) and you should get a <strong>Not
Found</strong> error. This is because the image has not been published
(if you do see the image at this point, you may have published it by
mistake when uploading).</p></li>
<li><p>In the Experience Manager editor use the <strong>switch
view</strong> to move from Admin View back to Assets View.</p></li>
<li><p>Navigate to the containing folder (<em>Training Assets</em>,
select the image and click <strong>publish</strong> in the blue actions
bar.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-introduction/assets/publish.png" width="321"/></p></li>
<li><p>Select the <em>AEM</em> checkbox in the modal dialog and
<strong>publish</strong>. A green notification panel will confirm that
the image was published.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-introduction/assets/publish_modal.png" width="240"/></p></li>
<li><p>Once again enter the publish instance URL for the image in a new
tab (the URL is <strong>similar</strong> to below). This time there will
be no <em>Not Found</em> error and the published image will either open,
or download.</p>
<pre><code>https://publish-p123456-e123456.adobeaemcloud.com/content/dam/wknd-shared/en/Training%20Assets/yourfolder/landscape_image_metadata_test.jpg</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Open the details panel of the test image and scroll to the bottom
of the panel. Note that the publish state and publishing time of the
asset is shown.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-introduction/assets/publishdata.png" width="321"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The publish mechanism creates a copy of the asset on the Experience
Manager publish server, and optionally to the Dynamic Media delivery
server.<br />
Until the release of the latest generation of AEM Assets tools (ca.
2024), this was the standard way to make images available for use by
asset consumers, or for use in Experience Manager (Sites) web pages.</p>
<p>We do not <strong>approve</strong> images in this exercise as we are
not using one of the new delivery channels (Content Hub or the Dynamic
Media API). Approval is a metadata field that only becomes relevant when
using these systems.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="delete-and-restore-the-image">Delete and Restore the image</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Navigate to your folder and use the ellipsis menu to delete your
test image, clicking first on the <strong>delete</strong> button in the
menu, then again on the delete button in the modal confirmation layer.
The image is removed from the UI.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-introduction/assets/delete_image.png" width="240"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Admin View (Touch UI) this is a final operation. Without the
restoration of a backup this cannot be undone. Assets View is different
and has a Trash folder. Images deleted using Assets View can be
restored.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>As only asset and folder titles are visible in the Trash tile
view, it can be difficult to find an image if there are others, as is
likely the case if your fellow students hsve also deleted their test
images. To overcome this, change to the <strong>list view</strong> as
shown below:</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m1-introduction/assets/trash_tileview.png" width="550"/></p></li>
<li><p>Locate your deleted image, click the ellipsis and then

<ol type="1">
<li><p>In the Assets View UI click the information icon in the details
panel, inspect the <strong>metadata</strong> in the <em>Basic</em> and
<em>Advanced</em> tabs. The fields are the defaults provided by
Adobe.</p></li>
<li><p>The image has much more metadata that you do not currently see.
You can see <strong>some</strong> of this ‘hidden’ metadata by
downloading the image and inspecting it on your computer (seeing
<strong>all</strong> metadata is beyond the scope of the exercise)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In MacOS right-click on the image and click on <strong>Get
info</strong> (result as in the screenshot below)</p></li>
<li><p>In Windows 11, right-click, then choose
<strong>Properties</strong>, then <strong>Details</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m2-metadata_search/assets/metadata.png" width="400"/></p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason you only see part of the metadata is because Adobe, and
the system administrator, have applied <strong>Metadata Forms</strong>,
so defining which metadata fields are visible and editable in the Assets
View user interface (these Metadata Forms are the equivalent of Metadata
Schemas in Admin View). By changing the Metadata Forms applied to
folders and MIME types, different metadata can be shown and edited, as
required for the asset management in your company.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="activity-2-2-apply-metadata-forms">Activity 2-2: Apply Metadata
Forms</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>From the left menu, select <strong>Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Metadata Forms</strong>. You may see an empty page if only the
default configurations are used as these defaults are invisible in the
UI. You can see the defaults by either:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>View the metadata in the details of an asset as we did in the
previous exercise.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a new form using an existing form structure as the
template. Although this is <strong>normally a power user or
administrator responsibility</strong>, we’ll do that now:</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In the Metadata Forms panel, click <strong>Create</strong>, then
enter *&lt;your initials&gt;_default* in the Name field of
<strong>Create Metadata Form</strong> panel, eg.,
<em>js_default</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m2-metadata_search/assets/new_form.png" width="245"/></p>
<p>(if you were to name the new form <em>default</em> you would override
the standard default form - <strong>DON’T do that</strong> in this
exercise. The default is applied to any assets that do not have forms
specific to their MIME types).</p></li>
<li><p>Select the <strong>checkbox</strong> <em>use existing form
structure as template</em> and the select <em>default</em> in the
<strong>Choose from</strong> field. Click
<strong>Create</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The Metadata Form Editor is loaded. The fields shown are copied
from the standard <em>default</em> form.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m2-metadata_search/assets/image17.png" width="602"/></p></li>
<li><p>We will make the metadata property <em>photoshop:City</em>
visible and editable in Assets View (photoshop:City is an Adobe metadata
field that could conceivably be important for your company, as the
location where the image was created or edited, however we are using it
merely as an example without a defined use-case!). Add a single-line
text field to the bottom of the form, then configure the form using:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Metadata property: City (photoshop:City)</p></li>
<li><p>Label: Photoshop City</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m2-metadata_search/assets/metadatacity.png" width="602"/></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Save</strong>, wait for a success message, then
<strong>Close</strong> to exit the form editor.</p></li>
<li><p>As your form is named neither <em>default</em> nor a MIME type,
it will not be used anywhere yet.</p></li>
<li><p>Now assign your form to your folder in Training Assets by
clicking <strong>Assign to Folders</strong> in the blue header bar, then
selecting <strong>your folder</strong> and clicking
<strong>Assign</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m2-metadata_search/assets/assign.png" width="602"/></p></li>
<li><p>Open your training asset detail. Your modified metadata form has
been applied and the field Photoshop City should now be visible, contain
<em>Offenburg</em> and be editable.</p></li>
<li><p>Return to your folder and upload in to your folder the
<strong>test.pdf</strong> file in your Exercise_Files.</p></li>
<li><p>After the asset has been processed open the details view and note
that your <strong>custom metadata form</strong> is being used, This may
not be desirable as a PDF is a different MIME type to an image, and by
default has a different, PDF specifc, metadata form than an image. An
example issue us that photoshop:City is irrelevant for a PDF.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="activity-2-3-metadata-challenge">Activity 2-3: Metadata
challenge!</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Solve this problem of the PDF file having the metadata
configuration of an image. Your PDF and your Image should be able to
exist inside your folder or child-folder(s), but with different,
MIME-type appropriate, metadata fields. The PDF should have the default
PDF metadata visible, and the image should have your custom metadata
visible.</p>
<blockquote>
Hints:
<ul>
<li>The name of the default Metadata Form for a PDF form is
<em>application</em>.</li>
<li>Key point: you cannot apply multiple Metadata Forms to a
folder.</li>

<li><p>Search for <em>Lake</em> to view a selection of results. Note
that you searched the entire DAM. When the results are shown you can
filter by path, but it is a secondary action.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the back arrow (ideally in Assets View, not the browser
back button).</p></li>
<li><p>If not already enabled, enabled the contextual search
functionality using the toggle to the right of the search field.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m2-metadata_search/assets/search_toggle.png" width="351"/></p></li>
<li><p>Enter <em>images of a lake uploaded in the last
week</em></p></li>
<li><p>You will see fewer images and a <em>Create Date</em> search
filter has been automatically added to the header search bar. This is
the result of the natural language search - creation of search
filters.</p></li>
<li><p>Experiment with natural language searches to explore the limits
of the contextual search.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is possible to add a custom filter to the search, for example the
photoshop:City. We will not do this as it is a central configuration
that we cannot change without conflict on the training system. In
reality it will be managed by an administrator, or power user. You
should just remember that configuration of search filters is possible,
and straight-forward in most cases.</p>

<h3 id="activity-3-1-my-workspace-and-quick-access">Activity 3-1: My
Workspace and Quick Access</h3>
<p>The <strong>My Workspace &gt; Quick Assets</strong> panel in Assets
View gives you quick access to the assets and folders you use most
frequently. You can “pin” items to this view so they are always visible
when you sign in.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>From the left navigation, select <strong>My Workspace</strong> to
open your personalized workspace. Notice the <em>Quick Access</em>
panel, which will probably be empty.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-productivity/assets/myworkspace.png" width="200"/></p></li>
<li><p>Now navigate to <strong>Assets &gt; WKND Shared &gt; English &gt;
Activities</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may still be in the List view from a previous exercise. To make
your system look like the screenshots, you can return to Grid View, use
the view switcher (top right of the main panel)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Hover over the <em>hiking</em> folder tile, click the
<strong>ellipsis (⋮)</strong> icon, and select <strong>Pin to Quick
Access</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-productivity/assets/pin_folder_menu.png" width="480"/></p></li>
<li><p>A modal dialog appears with multiple options. Select <strong>For
Myself</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>In the green confirmation message choose <strong>view</strong> or
navigate to <strong>My Workspace</strong> as before. The <em>hiking</em>
folder now appears as a pinned item in the <em>Quick Access -&gt; My
pinned items</em> tab. Had you chosen to pin for a group or organization
in the previous step, the folder would instead show in the <em>Shared
Items</em> tab.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-productivity/assets/my_pinned_items.png" width="320"/></p></li>
<li><p>Click on the <strong>ellipsis (⋮)</strong> in your pinned item
and click <strong>Open in a new tab</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-productivity/assets/open_pinned_item.png" width="420"/></p></li>
<li><p>The <em>hiking</em> folder opens. Click the <strong>ellipsis
(⋮)</strong> under an image you like and choose <strong>Pin to Quick
Access</strong>, in the same way that you added a folder in a previous
step.</p></li>
<li><p>Once again choose to pin <strong>For Myself</strong> and then
view the results in your Quick Access area (<em>My Workspace &gt; Quick
Access</em>).</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 <em>Pinning assets “For Myself” is similar to the “lightbox”
functionality of the older Admin View assets interface</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="activity-3-2-use-notifications-to-track-asset-activity">Activity
3-2: Use Notifications to Track Asset Activity</h3>
<p>You can receive notifications whenever assets you care about are
updated, published, or have metadata changes.<br />
Here you’ll <em>watch</em> a folder, then trigger a notification later
when we publish an updated image.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Navigate to the <em>Training Assets</em> folder.</p></li>
<li><p>(Tip: Read the next step before completing this one!) Select your
folder (for example, <em>RobF</em>) and in the blue actions bar choose
<strong>Watch</strong>. If you don’t see the <em>Watch</em> link, show
hidden items by clicking the ellipsis at the and of the bar a shown in
the screenshot below.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-productivity/assets/watch.png" width="480"/></p></li>
<li><p>A green confirmation message will be shown when the
<em>watch</em> has been successfully created. Note that a link to your
<strong>Notification Preferences</strong> is shown in the success
message. Click on this. If the message is no longer visible, you can
<strong>unwatch</strong> and <strong>watch</strong> again.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-productivity/assets/watch_notification.png" width="480"/></p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Notifications -&gt; Assets</strong> area of the
preferences page, ensure that all items are set to
<strong>In-app</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of exercise" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-productivity/assets/xc_notifications.png" width="380"/></p></li>
<li><p>Close the tab containing the notifications settings, so returning
to the Assets View UI.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Watched Assets</strong> link in the left menu
bar. Select the watched folder to see a list of your watches.</p>
<p><img alt="watched assets" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-productivity/assets/watched_assets.png" width="220"/></p></li>

<h3 id="activity-3-3-insights-and-reporting">Activity 3-3: Insights and
Reporting</h3>
<h4 id="view-asset-insights">View Asset Insights</h4>
<p>Assets View provides automatically generated insights that show how
assets are being used over time. These insights are available at a
global level and help authors understand overall asset usage trends.</p>
<p>In this activity, you’ll open the Insights view and review the
available charts.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>From the left navigation pane, click the Insights <em>graph
icon</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="watched assets" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-productivity/assets/insights.png" width="220"/></p>
<p>The Insights page opens, displaying automatically generated charts
based on asset usage.</p></li>
<li><p>Review the available charts.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the time range dropdowns to explore how asset activity
changes over time.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Insights provide authors with a simple high-level, read-only view of
asset usage without running reports or modifying content.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="activity-3-4-collections">Activity 3-4: Collections</h3>
<h4 id="create-and-add-assets-to-a-collection">Create and add assets to
a collection</h4>
<p>Collections let you group related assets — for example, all images
you plan to use in an upcoming campaign — without moving the original
files.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We’ll start by creating an empty Collection. Click on the
Collections icon in the sidebar, then <strong>Create a
Collection</strong>. Give you collection a simple name susch as
_your-initials-_Collection, select the <strong>private</strong> open and
click <strong>Create</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-productivity/assets/create_collection.png" width="420"/></p></li>
<li><p>From the <em>WKND Shared &gt; English &gt; Activities</em>
folder, find three images that you like, and for each:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click <strong>Add to Collection</strong> in the blue action menu
bar, then choose your Collection and click <strong>Add</strong>. A
confirmation message is shown and the Collection modal closes.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-productivity/assets/add-to-collection2.png" width="420"/></p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>You can also use an Asset’s ellipsis menu to <em>Add to
Collection</em>.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Navigate again to <strong>Collections</strong>.You see your
chosen images.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the images are <strong>not</strong> copies of the
originals. The collection is a kind of virtual folder containing only
references to the original images. For example you can delete a
Collection without the contained images being deleted from the system. A
collection is not as fully featured as a genuined folder. For example a
Collection cannot be used for bulk operations such as applying metadata,
nor can a Metadata Form be applied to a Collection.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="investigate-collection-permissions">Investigate collection
permissions</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>As you create a <strong>private</strong> collection, you can
control the access rights to your collection. To do this view your
Collection in the Collections panel, and choose <strong>Manage
permissions</strong> from the ellipsis menu.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-productivity/assets/collections_permissions.png" width="240"/></p></li>
<li><p>Note that you have automatically been added as the Collection
owner.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-productivity/assets/collections_permissions.png" width="240"/></p></li>
<li><p>We won’t apply and test permissions in this course, but if you’re
working with another student, feel free to experiment with the
permissions system by assigning permissions to them. To do this the next
section, sharing, may come in useful!</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="activity-3-5-sharing-links">Activity 3-5: Sharing links</h3>
<p>You can share a collection, folder or individual asset as a secure
link — useful for review or external collaboration.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Choose your original test image and choose <strong>Share
link</strong> from the ellipsis menu.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/home/runner/workspace/cli/modules/m3-productivity/assets/share_link.png" width="240"/></p></li>
<li><p>Copy the link from the link share dialog, and note that the link
has a unique ID. It is not just a simple path to the entity that you
shared, and does have an expiry time which you can set at this
point.</p></li>
<li><p>Open an incognito window, or a different browser in which you are
<strong>NOT logged in</strong> with an Adobe account.<br />
</p></li>
<li><p>Past the shared link into the address bar. Notice the link is to
an author URL such as:
<code>https://author-p123456-e123456.adobeaemcloud.com/linkshare.html?sh=_long_unique_id</code>,
and all content on an author instance would normally require
authentication.</p></li>
<li><p>Click return and see tha image is visible and can be downloaded
by your simulated <strong>unauthenticated user</strong> in the Link
Share viewer</p>
